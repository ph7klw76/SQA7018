## Scipy Curve Fit Supplementary Notes

1.  [Uncertainty_Gradients_Scientific_Parameter_Extraction](Uncertainty_Gradients_Scientific_Parameter_Extraction.md)
    Non-linear regression is often used in scientific contexts where parameter uncertainty plays a critical role. Gradients help in understanding the sensitivity of parameters.
2.  [Computational_Thinking](Computational_Thinking.md) How to think like a computer.
3.  [SciPy's _curve_fit](SciPy's_curve_fit.md) A common tool in SciPy, curve_fit allows fitting a curve to data by optimizing parameters based on least squares.
4.  [Jacobian_Matrix](Jacobian_Matrix.md) The Jacobian matrix represents the partial derivatives of functions, which is crucial in minimizing errors in non-linear regression.
5.  [Levenberg-Marquardt](Levenberg-Marquardt.md) his optimization method is particularly useful for non-linear least squares problems, balancing between gradient descent and Gauss-Newton methods.
6.  [Covariance_Matrix](Covariance_Matrix.md)  In non-linear regression, the covariance matrix is essential for quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates.
